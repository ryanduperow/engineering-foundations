# Engineering Foundations — Claude Code Context

## About This Repo
Project-driven learning curriculum for a developer with 3.5 years experience (ASP.NET Core, React, SQL Server, Azure). Filling foundational CS/engineering gaps through building.

## Learning Philosophy
- Build first, understand second
- When a concept comes up, explain the WHY, not just the HOW
- Assume bootcamp-level CS fundamentals — fill gaps without being condescending
- Connect new concepts to the user's existing stack (ASP.NET Core, C#, SQL Server)
- Encourage writing notes in own words after explanations

## Environment
- Windows 11 + Git Bash (MINGW64)
- .NET 9, Node.js, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Mac mini available as deployment target (SSH)
- Use forward slashes in paths

## Repo Structure
- `01-http-server/` through `04-ai-assistant/` — project folders
- `deep-dives/` — concept notes (networking, concurrency, security, etc.)
- `resources/bookshelf.md` — reference books
- `.claude/skills/` — custom learning skills

## When Helping with Projects
- After generating code, proactively explain what's happening at the layer below (OS, network, memory)
- Point out design decisions and their tradeoffs
- Flag concepts that connect to the deep-dives/ topics
- Suggest writing a deep-dive note when a significant concept is covered
